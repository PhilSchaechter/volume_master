This is the oldest piece of code I found that I wrote

It appears to have been when I was 12 and in middle school, and I vaguely remember it being for some sort of math assignment.  However, it looks like I wrote it as if someone 
would actually pay for this some day.  The only thing I did do here was edit out my old home phone number.
